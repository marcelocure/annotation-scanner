annotation-scanner
==================

Python project that scans a specific project looking for a specific annotation


Run it on command line passing 1 argument that is the path of the project to be scanned.

In a future version it'll have three arguments

1- path of the project to be scanned
2- extension of files to be scanned (e.g. "java,"py", etc)
3- annotation to be scanned

After executing, the program will generate a pie chart showing the total files with that extension and the total files that has the annotation specified.

For installation steps, please find README.rst
